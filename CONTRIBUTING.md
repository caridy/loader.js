# Contributing

Pull requests are very welcome, but should be within the scope of the project, and follow the repository's code conventions. Before submitting a pull request, it's always good to file an issue, so we can discuss the details of the PR.

## Reporting a Bug
1. Ensure you've replicated the issue against master.  There is a chance the issue may have already been fixed.

2. Search for any similar issues (both opened and closed).  There is a chance someone may have reported it already.

3. Provide a demo of the bug isolated in a jsfiddle/jsbin.  Sometimes this is not a possibility, in which case provide a detailed description along with any code snippets that would help in triaging the issue.  If we cannot reproduce it, we will close it.

4. The best way to demonstrate a bug is to build a failing test.  This is not required, however, it will generally speed up the development process.

## Submitting a pull request
1. [Fork][fork] the repository.

2. Ensure that all tests are passing prior to submitting.

3. If you are adding new functionality, or fixing a bug, provide test coverage.

4. Follow syntax guidelines detailed below.

5. Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request.  If this resolves any issues, please mark in the body `resolve #ID` within the body of your pull request.  This allows for github to automatically close the related issue once the pull request is merged.

6. Last step, [submit the pull request][pr]!
